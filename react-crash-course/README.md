## Overview

The JobFinder Platform is a robust and dynamic job listing website. It provides users with a comprehensive, filterable directory of job openings, utilizing the speed of Vite and the modularity of React to deliver a fast and modern application experience.

### The challenge

Efficient Filtering: Implementing efficient, chained filtering logic (by keyword, location, and salary range) over a large dataset.

Performance: Ensuring fast page loads and smooth client-side routing, leveraging Vite's optimization and React's component rendering.

Routing: Creating clean, navigable routes for both the main job listing view and individual job detail pages.

## My process
-Setup: Initiated the project using Vite with a React template.

Architecture: Established the main file structure, focusing on component modularity (JobCard, FilterBar, etc.).

Data Handling: Created a local JSON data source and set up state management to import and process the job listings.

UI/UX: Implemented a responsive layout and designed the filter bar for intuitive job search functionality.

Routing: Integrated the routing library to manage navigation between the home page and dynamic detail pages (/jobs/:id).

### Built with

- React: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.

-Vite: The modern frontend build tool used for development and bundling.

-[Styling Library/Method]: (e.g., Tailwind CSS / SASS) Used for rapid and responsive styling.

-[Routing Library]: (e.g., React Router DOM) For declarative navigation.
